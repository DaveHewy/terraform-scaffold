### Overview

Un-opinionated lightweight scaffolding of a basic terraform repo. Deliberately lightweight (& for the time being un-finished).

Yes there is a considerable amount more I could be doing with tf.sh & I may well add to that over the coming months. Most projects will not require additional complexity.

### Usage

<a name="bootstrap"></a>
##### Bootstrap

You can get setup using an s3 bucket as backend for terraform simply with the following. Be sure to check the variables.tf defaults and override them if you like.

```
cd terraform/bootstrap
terraform init
terraform plan -out tfplan.out
terraform apply "tfplan.out"
```

<a name="plan"></a>
##### Plan

dev plan >
```
cd bin/
./tf.sh plan dev eu-west-1
```

prod plan >
```
cd bin/
./tf.sh plan prod eu-west-1
```

### To do

- Add better examples in environments
- Show how components can be shared to the environment workspaces
- Allow for variables to be passed to the final terraform cmd from the bin/tf.sh wrapper
- Improve the bin/tf.sh wrapper
    - nice args
    - var passing to underlying cmd
    - pre-flight checks
    - input validation
